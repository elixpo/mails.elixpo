## About

**Elixpo Mails** is the multi-tenant, event-based transactional email service
for the Elixpo ecosystem. It helps a business send the everyday emails its
product needs to send — **receipts, welcome notes, order updates, password
resets, invoices** — beautifully designed, on-brand, and sent **automatically**
when something happens in their app.

No mail server to run. No email HTML to hand-write. No shared "noreply@" address —
the emails go out from **your own** mailbox, so they look like they came from you.
Within the ecosystem, Elixpo Mails is the **shared mailing infrastructure** that
backs the other Elixpo products.

> This repository is the source for the **mails.elixpo.com** hosted service.

### Who it's for

Any business or team that wants reliable, professional transactional email without
standing up a whole email platform. If your app needs to email a customer when they
sign up, pay, or place an order — this is for you.

### Why it's different

- **📤 Your own sender.** Connect your Gmail, Google Workspace, or any SMTP mailbox.
  Emails are sent *as you*, not from a shared pool — better trust and deliverability.
- **🎨 Design without code.** A visual editor (like writing a document) with
  `{{placeholders}}` for the bits that change per customer — names, amounts, links.
- **🏷️ On-brand by default.** Each product carries its own logo, address, phone, and
  footer, added to every email automatically.
- **📎 Attachments.** Attach a file from Google Drive, a link, or a per-send variable
  (e.g. each customer's own invoice).
- **🔕 Unsubscribe handled for you.** Built-in one-click unsubscribe and a suppression
  list, so you stay compliant without building anything.
- **📊 See every send.** A delivery log shows exactly what went out, to whom, and
  whether it landed.

### How it works — in four steps

1. **Connect a sender** — add the mailbox your emails should come from.
2. **Create a product** — this represents one of your services and holds its
   credentials and branding.
3. **Design a template** — write the email once, with `{{variables}}` for the
   personalized parts.
4. **Add a webhook** — your app calls a single secure URL when an event happens, and
   Elixpo Mails renders the template with that customer's details and sends it.

That's it — your product now sends polished, branded email on autopilot.

### Built on

Elixpo Mails runs entirely on **Cloudflare's edge** network for speed and
reliability — Pages + D1 + a `cloudflare:sockets` SMTP Worker (with send and
retry queues) — and signs in through **Elixpo Accounts** (SSO). Senders are
AES-GCM encrypted at rest, and webhooks are HMAC-signed. It's part of the Elixpo
suite of products and provides the shared mailing infrastructure for the rest of
the ecosystem.

Useful scripts (see `package.json` for the full list):

```bash
npm run build              # Production build
npm run pages:build        # Build for Cloudflare Pages
npm run lint               # Biome check
