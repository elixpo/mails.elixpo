                    mail.elixpo lets you connect your own email senders, design templates
                    with variable placeholders, and trigger transactional email sends from
                    your systems via an API and webhook. We render and relay messages
                    through the sender you configure; we are not your mailbox provider and
                    do not act as the sender of record.
