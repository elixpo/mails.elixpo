                    transactional and operational email — messages a recipient expects as a
                    result of an action they took.

                    responsible for following your mailbox provider’s policies and for
                    maintaining your domain’s authentication (such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC)
                    where applicable. Accurate “from” identities and truthful subject lines

                    responsible for the lawfulness of the recipient addresses and variables
                    you submit, and for responding to recipient privacy requests as the

                    terminate sending or accounts that breach this policy, with or without
                    notice where necessary to protect recipients or the service. Repeated
